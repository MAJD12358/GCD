## Features

### 1. Multilingual Support
GCD supports multiple programming languages, including Arabic, English, French, German, American English, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, and Java.

### 2. Advanced Server Integration
Utilize the GCD server for hosting and managing your applications. Configure server settings, specify page length, and enable advanced features like topic modeling, content clustering, and sentiment analysis.

### 3. Comprehensive Programming Guide
Benefit from a detailed programming guide that covers everything from defining the application name to implementing advanced features such as machine learning, augmented reality, and voice recognition.

### 4. UI Design with Ui+
Design aesthetically pleasing user interfaces using the Ui+ syntax, incorporating elements and visual aesthetics suited to the application's requirements.

### 5. AdMob Integration
Monetize your applications by seamlessly integrating AdMob with GCD. Enable programmers to create a copy of AdMob data with `admob_copy~#`.

### 6. Firebase Services
Integrate Firebase services into your application effortlessly using `firebase~#`. Enhance user experience with real-time interaction using `realtime~#`.

### 7. AI Tools
Enhance your application with AI capabilities, including natural language processing, computer vision, predictive analytics, and machine learning models.

### 8. Brackets Support
Organize your code logically using brackets support. Use `<>` for opening brackets and `</>` for closing brackets.

### 9. Animation and Icons
Leverage GCD's capability to create advanced user interfaces with animated elements. Specify animation details with `Animation~`. Enhance the user interface with icons using `icon#` syntax.

### 10. Tools and Styles
Integrate tools for enhanced styling and design using `#style~`.

### 11. Punctuation
Enhance code readability by incorporating common punctuation marks, such as `!` for emphasis, `;` for terminating statements, `؛` for alternative statement termination, and `؟` for the Arabic question mark.

## Getting Started
1. Define the application name using `name~~`.
2. Use `text~#` for highlighted code during text operations.
3. Enhance documentation with images using `photo~#`.
